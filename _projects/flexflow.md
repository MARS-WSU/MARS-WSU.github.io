L2S is a learning to search framework that automatically discovers high quality power managment policies for large manycore systems. L2S generalizes and goes beyond today's manually designed non-ML methods such as linux governors for resource management by exploring power saving opportunities at minimal performance overhead across different HPC applications.

Learning to Search (L2S) framework provides the following key features:

* **Automated Learning and Search Process**. Bayesian Optimization enabled automated search process for finding optimal Dynamic power management policies.

<!-- FlexFlow supports parallelizing DNN training through combinations of the [Sample, Operator, Attribute, and Parameter](https://cs.stanford.edu/~zhihao/papers/sysml19a.pdf) dimensions, and guarantees that different parallelization strategies maintain the same model accuracy by design. -->

<!-- * **Performance Autotuning**. To accelerate DNN training on a specific parallel machine, FlexFlow uses guided randomized search to automatically find fast parallelization strategies while requiring no manual effort. -->
