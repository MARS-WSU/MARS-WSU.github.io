    <h2>Mission</h2>
    The rapid advance in ML models and ML-specific hardware makes it increasingly challenging to build
    efficient and scalable learning systems that can take full advantage of the performance capability of modern hardware and runtime environments.
    Today's ML systems heavily rely on human effort to optimize the training and deployment of ML models on specific target platforms.
    Unlike conventional application domains, learning systems need to address a continuously growing complexity and diversity
    in machine learning models, hardware backends, and runtime time environments.

    Our response to this unique challenge in ML systems is <b>Catalyst</b> (CMU automated learning systems group), a joint research group
    across the area of machine learning, systems, programming languages, and computer architecture.
    Our mission is to build ML algorithms and learning systems that automate cross stack optimizations by leveraging mathematical and statistical properties of ML computations
    and by co-designing systems, hardware, and ML algorithms.
